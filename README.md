Morfando (Local) is an app that manages reservations at gastronomic establishments.

Using Morfando (Local) you will be able to manage all the reservations made in your local.

## How does the app work?
Once you have an admin account, you can start receiving reservations that people make and then confirm, modify and/or reject them based on the available tables at your place.

When people book at your place, you will receive a notification with all the details of the reservation, as well as when they cancel them in case they cannot attend the place.
